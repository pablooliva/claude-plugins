# Research Completion

RESEARCH COMPLETION

Research is complete. Finalize findings and determine next steps.

## 1. Verify Research Document Completeness

Confirm that `PACE/research/RESEARCH-[###]-[topic-name].md` contains complete information:

### Core Content

- [ ] Executive summary captures the key question and main findings
- [ ] Information sources are documented (online, documents, references)
- [ ] Key concepts and definitions are explained
- [ ] Main insights are clearly articulated

### Analysis Quality

- [ ] Patterns and connections between findings are identified
- [ ] Contradictions or conflicting information are addressed
- [ ] Open questions are documented for future investigation

### Practical Value

- [ ] Immediate applications are identified
- [ ] Resources and references are organized for future use
- [ ] Actionable insights are highlighted

## 2. Finalize Research Document

Ensure the research document:
- Answers the core research question
- Provides sufficient depth for the intended purpose
- Is organized for easy reference later

## 3. Record Completion

Update `PACE/prompts/context-management/progress.md`:

```
Research complete. RESEARCH-[###]-[topic-name].md finalized.
```

## 4. Determine Next Steps

Choose one:

**Research Complete (Standalone)**
- Research was the goal - work is done
- Document is ready for reference

**Continue to Planning**
- Use findings to create an action plan
- Run `/planning-start` to begin planning

**Continue to Execution**
- Skip planning, go directly to producing deliverables
- Run `/execution-start` to begin execution

**More Research Needed**
- Current findings reveal need for deeper investigation
- Continue research or start new research thread

## Research Phase Complete

Findings are documented and ready for use. Proceed based on your goals.
